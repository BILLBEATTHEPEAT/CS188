Problem Set 5 (Part 2): Neural networks
=======================================

The questions of part 2 are numbered 7-9.  This part of the assignment will give
you some experience using convolutional neural networks on two different tasks
which we used earlier in the assignment digit classification and behavioral
cloning.

Before we start: These question require the pytorch package.  If you would like
to install pytorch on your local machine please follow the instructions on the
pytorch webpage: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

You will be writing code in 3 different files - one per question.

  - Q7: dnn.py
  - Q8: dnn_digits.py
  - Q9: dnn_pacman.py

Unlike your other assignments, the instructions are written alongside the
code. PLEASE READ EACH OF THESE 3 FILES CAREFULLY!

Lastly, this is a new assignment so there may be hiccups along the way.  Please
keep an eye on Piazza for any clarifications that we announce.  Also, please
post any questions about the assignment to Piazza.
